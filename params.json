This website serves as a gallery of statistical graphics and visualizations with reproducible program code that makes the plots. The website is built with the **knitr** package and hosted on Github with Jekyll.\r\n\r\n## How to contribute\r\n\r\nYou can fork our repository, add your own examples and submit pull requests to us. Of course, you have to learn GIT if you do not know how to use it. Please use pull requests, and forget about emails.\r\n","google":"","name":"Vistat","tagline":"A gallery of statistical graphics and visualizations"}
